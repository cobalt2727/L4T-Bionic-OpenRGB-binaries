# L4T-Bionic-OpenRGB-binaries
The .deb files on the [Releases](../releases/latest) page are designed to be able to run on Ubuntu 18.04 on arm64 devices.

Realistically, this only applies to [Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) or [Nintendo Switch](https://switchroot.org) users.
The build process is still in an early state (mostly because my environment on my Jetson Nano is an absolute mess), so feedback is appreciated!
