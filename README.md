# OpenRGB binaries for L4T Ubuntu 18.04
Check out the .deb files on the [Releases](../releases/latest) page to get started.

Realistically, this only applies to [Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) or [Nintendo Switch](https://switchroot.org) users.
The build process is still in an early state (mostly because my environment on my Jetson Nano is an absolute mess), so feedback is appreciated!

Check out the [L4T Megascript](https://github.com/cobalt2727/L4T-Megascript) if you haven't already - this'll get worked in there eventually.
